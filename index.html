Garcia is a native of the South Texas farming community, Palito Blanco. The eighth of ten children, Sylvia learned at an early age the value of education and hard work. Growing up, she saw her parents struggle to raise those ten children. And because of their struggles, her parents wanted to make sure each one their children had a good education in order to better their lives.

As a result, Sylvia worked hard and attended Texas Woman's University on a scholarship, graduating with a degree in social work. But she didn't stop there. She then received her Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University.

Aside from acquiring her education, Sylvia knew it was also her responsibility to give back to her community. As a social worker early in her professional career, Sylvia protected our community's most vulnerable. Whether it was our children or our elderly, she made sure no one was forgotten.

Shortly afterwards, Sylvia entered her public service career with the City of Houston. She served as Director and Presiding Judge of the Houston Municipal System for an unprecedented five terms under two mayors. There, she made our city court system effective and efficient for our community.

When Sylvia was elected to City Controller, she earned a reputation as the taxpayers' watchdog that fought to protect the pocketbooks of working families. Recalling the struggles of her own parents, she knew every dollar counts when raising a family. That is why she made sure city government was transparent and accountable.

In 2002, Sylvia was elected to Harris County Commissioner's Court. The first Hispanic and first woman to be elected in her own right to the office, she continued her advocacy for working families and made certain Harris County took care of its most vulnerable, all while making certain Harris County led the way for new jobs and economic development.

Active in the Houston community, Sylvia has served on more than 25 community boards and commissions, including the San Jacinto Girl Scouts, the Houston Hispanic Forum, the American Leadership Forum, Battleship Texas and the Museum of Fine Arts - Houston.

Sylvia has been named Humanitarian of the Year by the National Conference of Communities and Justice and chosen as one of Houston's 25 Power People by Inside Houston magazine. She is also a recipient of the Texas Woman's University Board of Regents Woman of Distinction Award, the Hispanic Scouting Distinguished Citizen Award from the Sam Houston Area Council/Boy Scouts of America, and the Board Award from the San Jacinto Girl Scouts.

Sylvia Garcia has dedicated her life to her community and to public service. Just like her parents believed in her future, she believes in the future of Texas families that depend on quality education for our children.">

    	<h2 class="text-center">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3><strong><i>Where should I park?</i></strong></h3>
        	<p>Daily self-parking at the Hyatt Regency Austin for Summit attendees is $5 per day. Attendees should make an immediate right-hand turn towards the garage entrance at the Hyatt Regency. All guests must take a ticket to gain entry to the garage, and should park as usual. To receive the $5 discounted parking, you will need to pick up a ticket at the registration table.
 <br>
 <br>
Upon exit, guests should use both tickets to obtain the discounted $5.00 rate. (There will be a Garage Concierge posted at the machine to assist guests with exiting the garage each day).
 <br>
 <br>
Overnight self-parking is $23, and valet parking is $18.00 per car. Additionally, there are parking meters and other parking garages accessible to the Hyatt Regency.</p>
<br>
<h3><strong><i>Where is check-in?</i></strong></h3>
        	<p>Registration and breakfast will be available in the Zilker Atrium Foyer starting at 7:30 am on both Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with our first plenary session starting at 8:30 am in the Zilker Ballroom.
 <br>
 <br>
From the parking garage, take the elevator to the Zilker Ballroom level (2R) and then take the escalator/stairs down one level (an additional elevator is also available). If you enter through the lobby in the main building, follow the Dare Texas Summit signs to registration.</p>
<br>
